# AotoEncoder
This project highlights various types of autoencoders and their applications across different tasks.

## Introduction:
Autoencoders are a type of artificial neural network used in deep learning to learn efficient representations of data, typically for the purpose of dimensionality reduction or data compression. Here's a brief overview:
# What is an Autoencoder?
An autoencoder consists of two main parts:
## Encoder: 
Compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation.
## Decoder:
Reconstructs the original data from the compressed representation.
# How Do Autoencoders Work?
## Training: 
Autoencoders are trained to minimize the difference between the input and the reconstructed output. This process helps the network learn the most important features of the data.
## Applications:
They are used for tasks such as image denoising, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and even generating new data.
# Types of Autoencoders:

## Vanilla Autoencoders:
Basic form, used for simple data compression.

## Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):
Used for generating new data similar to the input data.

## Denoising Autoencoders: 
Trained to remove noise from data.

## Sparse Autoencoders: 
Encourage sparsity in the hidden layers, useful for feature learning.
